# This repository contains multiple R and Python Source Code as well as markdown documents and pdfs that provide the analysis done using the HeartDPredCleavland example Dataset to conduct statistical analysis on, as well as testing different machine learning models and comparing their accuracy on the testing data partition.                                  To see the output of the markdown code check the ROutput or PythonOutput PDF FILE

If you wish to run this code yourself you must do the following:

-----------FOR R CODE:------------
You can simply open either the RandomForest R file or the Statistical Analysis file in RSTUDIO and run there, or copy and paste the code into RSTUDIO and run.

If you are running the Random Forest Prediction software code, you can use the console in RSTUDIO to input the information Requested to see the Random Forest models predicted value.
----------------------------------
