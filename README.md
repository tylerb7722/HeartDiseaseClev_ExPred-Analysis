# This repository contains multiple R Source Code as well as markdown documents and pdfs that provide the analysis done using the HeartDPredCleavland example Dataset to conduct statistical analysis on, as well as testing different machine learning models and comparing their accuracy on the unsupervised testing partition.
To see the output of the markdown code check the ROutput PDF FILE

If you wish to run this code yourself you must do the following:

-----------FOR R CODE:------------
You can simply open either the RandomForest R file or the Statistical Analysis file in RSTUDIO and run there, or copy and paste the code into RSTUDIO and run.
